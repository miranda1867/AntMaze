### Ant Class
The `Ant` class represents the ant controlled by the player, including its properties and ability. Each ant has a name, a unique ability, and coordinates in the maze. The class includes methods to use the ant's ability and manage cooldowns.

### Maze Class
The `Maze` class manages the maze structure and interactions. It initializes the maze, allows movement of the ant, and places barriers. The maze can be printed to the console to visualize the current state.

### MazeGenerator Class
The `MazeGenerator` class is responsible for generating the maze using Prim's algorithm. It initializes the maze with walls and creates paths by randomly selecting walls and checking their neighboring cells. The class includes methods to generate the maze, check if a cell is part of the path, and add neighboring walls to the processing list.

### Cell Class
The `Cell` class represents a single cell in the maze. It tracks whether the cell is an obstacle and whether it is hidden from view.
